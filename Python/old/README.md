# Old Python projects

Including the ones made for uni in my first year

Everything is ordered chronologically.


## Folder Naming Convention

If given multiple small assignments, use `"Lec{}".format(lecture_number)`

Otherwise use CamelCase and relevant name.

Unfinished projects may break these standards.


## Inside each project folder
- **CW** is classwork

- **HW** is homework

*If neither is present, it doesn't matter*

- **README.md** gives relevant info
