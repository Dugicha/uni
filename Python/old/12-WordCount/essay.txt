Dear George Soros,
  I am writing on behalf of the managing director to thank you for attending the charity dinner. 
  It was a pleasure to have you participate in this unnecessarily overfunded event.

  With the assistance of many generous supporters and public figures such as you, we managed to 
  raise more than two hundred thousand trillion rupees which will help Logistaid advance tuition in
  countries that need it the most and will definitely not be used to subsidize the luxurious lifestyles
  of our management team.

  I am extremely happy that you were chosen to promote Logistaid's new educational programme. Your 
  appearance at the dinner nearly doubled the donation rate for the cause. Since your meer presence
  generates so much revenue for the company, we will definitely want you to attend more charity brunches, lunches, and dinners.

  I also wanted to follow the event up with an offer to take part in a forthcoming meeting which I 
  am organising. With the influence of public figures such as you, we could raise its awareness to 
  help fund future projects. If it is possible, I would be thrilled to discuss more details of the 
  campaign with you over some traditional Lobster Frittata on my custom-designed German yacht.

  Thank you for your patronage.

  I look forward to further collaboration.

  Yours sincerely,

  Nikoloz Otiashvili
